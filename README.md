# BdayCheck
This program reads in a csv file with names and birthdays

It then runs a function to take input from the user, they input a date and it checks to see whose birthday is on that date

It then runs 2 more functions, one that tells you what their zodiac function is,

the other pulls a random message from a dataframe and prints their name, date, zodiac function, and message
